# Virtual-mouse-control-using-finger-gesture-recognition
In human-computer interaction, virtual mouse implemented with finger tip recognition and hand gesture
tracking based on image in a live video is one of the studies. In this study, virtual mouse control using finger tip identification
and hand gesture recognition is proposed. This study consists of two methods for tracking the fingers, one is by using colored
caps and other is by hand gesture detection. This includes three main steps that are finger detection using color identification,
hand gesture tracking and implementation on on-screen cursor. In this study, hand gesture tracking is generated through the
detection of the contour and formation of a convex hull around it. Features of hands are extracted with the area ratio of
contour and hull formed. Detailed tests are performed to check this algorithm in real world scenarios.
Using bare fingers, contour detection and convex hull technique, various operations of mouse can be controlled by different combinations of fingers at a particular time. For instance, one finger at a time for cursor motion, two fingers for left click etc. Finger tips are tracked and accordingly mouse operation is controlled.
Using hand gesture recognition, fingers can be detected. Different fingers and their combinations can be used for various operations. This is quite useful in many fields like gaming, controlling computer, android based TVs without any physical touch. Even in the
field of teaching, it can be useful during presentations.
