# Virtual-mouse-control-using-finger-gesture-recognition
In human-computer interaction, virtual mouse implemented with finger tip recognition and hand gesture
tracking based on image in a live video is one of the studies. In this study, virtual mouse control using finger tip identification
and hand gesture recognition is proposed. This study consists of two methods for tracking the fingers, one is by using colored
caps and other is by hand gesture detection. This includes three main steps that are finger detection using color identification,
hand gesture tracking and implementation on on-screen cursor. In this study, hand gesture tracking is generated through the
detection of the contour and formation of a convex hull around it. Features of hands are extracted with the area ratio of
contour and hull formed. Detailed tests are performed to check this algorithm in real world scenarios.
